# Host file 

The host file contain coordinates and peculiar velocities to simulate SN, the needed keys are given in the next table

| redshift | ra (rad) | dec (rad) | v_radial (km/s) |
| :-----------: | :-----: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Redshift of the host | Right ascension of the host | Declinaison of the host | Velocity along the line of sight |



Note that you can used the redshift distribution of your host to generate SN redshift distribution. 

|               mass               |
| :------------------------------: |
| The host mass in arbitrary units |

Additionally you can use a **mass** columns to weight the distribution with host masses : $w_i = \frac{m_i}{\sum_i m_i}$
