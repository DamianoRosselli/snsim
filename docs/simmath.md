# Formula used in the simulation

## SN Ia flux and distance moduli

The flux of a SN Ia in a band **b** at the obs-frame phase **p** is simulate by *sncosmo* with the following formula :

$$F_b(p) = \frac{1}{1+z}\frac{1}{4\pi d_L^2}\int_0^{+\infty} \phi_b\left(\frac{\lambda}{1+z}, \frac{p}{1+z}\right)T_b\left(\lambda\right)\frac{\lambda}{hc} d\lambda$$

where **$\phi_b$** is the restframe flux density and **$\lambda$** the obs-frame wavelength.

The flux is re-scaled in **ADU** units by applying the following factor:

$$F_b^{ADU} = 10^{-0.4 m_B} 10^{\left(ZP_{obs} - ZP_{AB}\right)}$$

The observed magnitude is given by the absolute magnitude **$M_B$** and the distance moduli **$\mu$** :

$$m_B = M_B + \mu$$

In the simulation **$\mu$** is computed as:

$$\mu = 5 \log\left((1+z_{vp})^2 (1+z_{2cmb}) (1+z_{cos})r(z_{cos})\right) + 25$$

with :

* **$z_{cos}$** the cosmological redshift
* **$z_{vp}$** the redshift due to the peculiar velocity of the SN / CMB
* **$z_{2cmb}$** the redshift due to our peculiar motion / CMB
* **$r(z)$** the comoving distance

## Noise formula

The flux error is computed as :

$$\sigma^2_F = \frac{F}{G} + \sigma_{skynoise}^2 + \left(\frac{\ln(10)}{2.5}F\sigma_{zp}\right)^2$$

The first term is the Poisson noise with **G** the gain in $ e^- $ / ADU.

The second term is the noise from sky flux. If there is a PSF given this term take into account the PSF by applying :

$$\sigma_{skynoise}^2  *= 4\pi\sigma_{PSF}^2$$

If you use limiting magnitude at 5Ïƒ, sky-noise is computed as :

$$\sigma_{skynoise} = \frac{1}{5}10^{0.4\left(ZP - m_{5\sigma}\right)}$$

The last term is the propagation of the zero point incertitude.
