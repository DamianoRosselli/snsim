# Host file 

The host file contain coordinates and peculiar velocities to simulate SN, the needed keys are given in the next table

| redshift | ra (rad) | dec (rad) | vp_sight (km/s) |
| :-----------: | :-----: | :----------: | :----------: |
| Redshift of the host | Right ascension of the host | Declinaison of the host | Velocity along the line of sight |
