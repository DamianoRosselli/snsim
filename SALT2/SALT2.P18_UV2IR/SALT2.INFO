# The SALT2.B14-JLA model from 3500-8000A is left untouched. 
# The UV is updated/extrapolated blueward of 3500 using 
# Foley 2016 Ia-UV model. Redward of 8000A, model update is
# based on 45 low-z SNIa IR spectra. The SALT2 color law is 
# extended into the NIR (beyond the nominal 7000A) using 
# a dust extinction law with RV=3.1. This model is NOT a 
# retraining of the original SALT2 model, but instead is a 
# first-order extrapolation to NIR (and UV) wavelengths. 
# Now covers 1700-25000A.
# Intended use is for forecast simulations, or for LC fitting 
# where high precision is not required. Not intended for use
# in a cosmology analysis.

# Aug 27 2019 update by Justin Pierel
# SEDs.P18-UV2IR SALT2 M0 version 2.0
# Original extended version and original SALT2 had different definitions 
# of "zero flux", which caused unphysical jumps at early phases.
# This version fixes that, with repairs made to phases -20-->-12 near 
# the 8500A split. The M1 component is not modified.
